The Odin Project Recipe Website

Pre-project entry:

First task to create a basic recipe website using fondational HTML knowledge

Main areas being covered:
-headings
-paragraphs and text layout
- links
- images
- cooking and baking knowledge

Post-project entry:

This was a successful first attempt at basic website design 
I experimented with adding the link to both an image and heading which was successful
I also successfully implemented a special character using the <span> function 
- This required a google search to learn how to do and to find the character code

I achieved the project aims which were to insert working links, images, lists and basic website layout.
